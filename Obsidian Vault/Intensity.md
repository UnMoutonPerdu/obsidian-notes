**Bike (FTP-based):**

- Z1 recovery: `<55% FTP`
    
- Z2 endurance: `60–70% FTP`
    
- Tempo / Sweet spot: `80–88% FTP`
    
- Threshold: `95–100% FTP`
    
- VO₂max: `110–120% FTP`
    

**Run (pace-based):**

- Easy: conversational, ~+60–90s/km slower than 10k pace
    
- Marathon pace 
    
- Threshold: tends to be 21k pace but actually slower
    
- Hard: 10k pace or faster (used sparingly)

## Intensity during the week

A recovery week should not contain any intensity or very little (like tempo bike or marathon pace run)
A build week should be built with separate intensities. 
- As a beginner, at least one full day between intensity trainings. SHOULD NOT put bike intensities and run intensities the same day. 
- With time and experience, can start concentrate intensities on one day. But should keep good rest between sessions.
