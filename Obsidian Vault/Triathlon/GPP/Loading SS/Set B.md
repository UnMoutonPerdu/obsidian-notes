### Upper Body (Swimming Focus)

**1. Pull-Ups or Assisted Pull-Ups**
- 6-10 reps (adjust based on ability)
- Use band for assistance if needed
- OR: Inverted rows if no pull-up ability
- Focus: Full range, control down
- **Why:** Swimming power, lat strength

**2. Single-Arm Dumbbell Row**
- 12 reps each arm
- Bench support or hinged stance
- Pull to hip, elbow stays close to body

- **Why:** Swimming pull phase, back strength

**3. Dumbbell Shoulder Press**
- 12-15 reps
- Seated or standing
- Press overhead, control down
- Don't arch back excessively
- **Why:** Shoulder stability, injury prevention

**4. Band External Rotations**
- 15 reps each arm
- Elbow at 90°, tight to side
- Rotate forearm outward against band
- Light resistance, focus on control
- **Why:** Rotator cuff strength = [[Common Injuries|shoulder injury prevention]]

**5. Push-Up to T (or regular push-up)**
- 10-12 reps
- Push up, rotate to side plank position
- Alternate sides
- OR: standard push-ups if rotation too difficult
- **Why:** Chest, shoulder, core rotation

### Core (Bike/Run Stability)

**6. Dead Bug**
- 20 total (10 each side)
- Lie on back, opposite arm and leg extend
- Keep low back pressed to floor
- Slow, controlled movement
- **Why:** Core stability without flexion/extension

**7. Side Plank with Hip Dips**
- 10 dips each side
- Hold side plank, lower hip to ground and raise
- Can be on knee if full side plank too hard
- **Why:** Lateral core stability for running

**8. Bird Dog**

## Notes

- Ideal after swim session (muscles already activated)
- Can do after easy run/bike
- Don't do day before hard bike or swim session
- Upper body work = swimming injury prevention
- Core work = better bike position and run economy
