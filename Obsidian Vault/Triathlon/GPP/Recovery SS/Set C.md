# Strength Set C - Recovery & Maintenance

**Duration:** 30-35 minutes
**Frequency:** Once per [[Recovery Week]]
**Equipment needed:** Minimal (bodyweight, light bands, foam roller)

---

## Purpose

During recovery weeks, strength training shifts to:
- **Maintain movement patterns** (not build strength)
- **Mobility and stability** focus
- **Reduced load** (50-60% of loading week)
- **Active recovery** for muscles

**This is NOT the week to PR your squat!**

## Principles for Recovery Week Strength

**DO:**
- Maintain movement quality
- Focus on feeling muscles work
- Use time for mobility work
- Enjoy lighter loads

**DON'T:**
- Try to lift heavy
- Add extra rounds or exercises
- Push through fatigue
- Skip it entirely (movement aids recovery)

---

## Modifications

**If feeling very fatigued:**
- Reduce to 1 round only
- Skip entirely if needed (listen to your body)
- Replace with yoga or long walk

**If feeling good:**
- DON'T add more
- Stick to the plan
- Recovery is the goal, not more training stress

---

## Notes

- Best done early in [[Recovery Week]] (Monday or Tuesday)
- Should feel **refreshing**, not exhausting
- You should leave feeling better than when you started
- If sore the next day, you went too hard

**Recovery week strength = active recovery, not training stimulus.**
