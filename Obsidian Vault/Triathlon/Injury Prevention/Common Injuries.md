## Triathlon's Most Common Injuries

Triathlon involves repetitive movements across three disciplines. Most injuries are **overuse injuries** from accumulated stress, not acute trauma.

**Prevention >> Treatment**

---

## Running Injuries

### 1. Runner's Knee (Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome)

**Symptoms:**
- Pain around or behind kneecap
- Worse going downhill or down stairs
- Pain after sitting with bent knees

**Common causes:**
- Weak glutes and hip stabilizers
- Overstriding
- Too much volume too fast

**Prevention:**
- [[General Principles|Strength training]] for glutes and hips
- Proper run mechanics (cadence 170-180 spm)
- Gradual volume increases

---

### 2. Achilles Tendinopathy

**Symptoms:**
- Pain and stiffness in Achilles (especially morning)
- Worse after rest, improves slightly with movement
- Tender to touch

**Common causes:**
- Rapid increase in speed work or hills
- Tight calves
- Inadequate recovery

**Prevention:**
- Calf strengthening (heel raises, eccentric heel drops)
- Don't spike intensity suddenly
- Adequate recovery between hard runs
- Proper warm-up

---

### 3. Plantar Fasciitis

**Symptoms:**
- Heel pain, especially first steps in morning
- Improves with movement, returns after rest

**Common causes:**
- Weak foot muscles
- Tight calves
- Rapid increase in volume
- Old/unsupportive shoes

**Prevention:**
- Calf stretching and strengthening
- Foot strengthening (toe grabs, single leg balance)
- Replace running shoes every 500-800 km
- Don't go barefoot on hard surfaces at home

---

### 4. IT Band Syndrome

**Symptoms:**
- Sharp pain on outside of knee
- Typically during run, at specific point
- May force you to stop

**Common causes:**
- Weak hip abductors (glutes)
- Downhill running
- Cambered roads (always running same side)

**Prevention:**
- Hip and glute strength work
- Vary running surfaces and directions
- Foam rolling (hip/TFL area, not IT band directly)

---

## Cycling Injuries

### 1. Knee Pain (Anterior/Patellar)

**Symptoms:**
- Pain in front of knee
- During or after cycling

**Common causes:**
- Saddle too low
- Pedaling at very low cadence (grinding big gears)
- Cleat position wrong (too far forward)

**Prevention:**
- Bike fit (professional if recurring)
- Cadence 85-95 rpm for most riding
- Proper cleat position (ball of foot over pedal axle)
- Gradual increase in volume/intensity

---

### 2. Lower Back Pain

**Symptoms:**
- Dull ache in lower back
- Worse in aero position
- May radiate to hips

**Common causes:**
- Poor core strength
- Too aggressive position (too low)
- Saddle too high or too far back
- Lack of flexibility

**Prevention:**
- [[General Principles|Core strength training]]
- Gradual adaptation to aero position
- Proper bike fit
- Hip flexor stretching

---

### 3. Neck Pain/Stiffness

**Symptoms:**
- Neck soreness during/after rides
- Particularly in aero position

**Common causes:**
- Too much time in aero without adaptation
- Poor core engagement
- Aggressive position

**Prevention:**
- Build aero position time gradually
- Strengthen neck and upper back
- Don't force aero if not ready
- Break up aero position on long rides

---

### 4. Hot Spots / Numbness

**Symptoms:**
- Hand numbness (ulnar nerve)
- Foot numbness or pain
- "Hot spots" on feet

**Common causes:**
- Too much pressure on one area
- Shoes too tight
- Poor bike fit
- Gripping bars too tightly

**Prevention:**
- Proper bike fit
- Padded gloves
- Move hand positions frequently
- Properly sized shoes
- Relax grip on bars

---

## Swimming Injuries

### 1. Swimmer's Shoulder (Impingement)

**Symptoms:**
- Pain in front or side of shoulder
- Painful during/after swimming
- Particularly during certain part of stroke

**Common causes:**
- High volume without adaptation
- Poor stroke mechanics (dropped elbow)
- Muscle imbalances (overdeveloped chest/lats)
- Inadequate shoulder stability

**Prevention:**
- [[Swim Drills|Proper technique]] (high elbow catch)
- Gradual volume increase (10% rule)
- Shoulder stability and rotator cuff strengthening
- Adequate recovery

---

### 2. Shoulder Tendinopathy

**Symptoms:**
- Pain in shoulder
- Gradual onset
- May worsen over time if ignored

**Common causes:**
- Overuse without recovery
- Muscle imbalances
- Poor mechanics

**Prevention:**
- Strength work for rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers
- Address technique issues
- Don't spike volume suddenly
- Mix up strokes (not just freestyle)

---

## Injury Prevention Principles

### 1. The 10% Rule

**Don't increase weekly training load by more than 10% week-over-week.**

Applies to:
- Total volume
- Single-discipline volume
- [[Training Stress Score|TSS]]

---

### 2. Respect Recovery

- [[Recovery Week]] is not optional
- [[Sleep and Recovery|Sleep]] is primary recovery tool
- Don't ignore persistent small aches

**Small ache ignored = major injury later**

---

### 3. Strength Training is Injury Prevention

**[[General Principles|GPP/Strength training]] is not optional** for injury prevention:
- Strengthens muscles, tendons, connective tissue
- Corrects imbalances
- Increases resilience to repetitive stress

**Key areas:**
- Glutes and hips (running)
- Core (cycling, running, swimming)
- Shoulders and rotator cuff (swimming)
- Posterior chain (all disciplines)

---

### 4. Listen to Your Body

**Pain is a signal, not a challenge to push through.**

**Good pain (temporary):**
- Muscle fatigue during hard workout
- Mild soreness 24-48h after hard session

**Bad pain (warning sign):**
- Sharp, localized pain
- Pain that changes your gait/stroke/pedal
- Pain that persists after warm-up
- Pain that worsens during activity
- Morning stiffness that doesn't improve

**If in doubt, take a rest day.** One missed day << 6 weeks injured.

---

### 5. Address Problems Early

**As soon as you feel something off:**
1. Reduce volume/intensity immediately
2. Identify probable cause
3. Address root cause (strength work, mobility, form)
4. Don't return to previous load until pain-free

**Consult physiotherapist if:**
- Pain persists >1 week despite rest
- Pain keeps returning
- Pain significantly alters movement
- Unsure of cause

---

### 6. Proper Warm-Up

**Dynamic warm-up before every workout:**
- 5-10 min easy movement
- Dynamic stretches (leg swings, arm circles)
- Progressive intensity (don't start hard cold)

**Cold muscles and tendons = injury risk**

---

### 7. Equipment Matters

**Running shoes:**
- Replace every 500-800 km
- Proper fit (toe room, heel lock)
- Consider rotation (alternate models)

**Bike fit:**
- Professional fit if spending significant time cycling
- Can prevent months of knee/back pain

**Swim gear:**
- Pull buoy to rest legs when needed
- Paddles: use sparingly and correctly

---

## When to Take Time Off

**Mandatory rest/medical attention:**
- Sharp, persistent pain
- Pain that wakes you up
- Swelling/inflammation
- Pain during normal daily activities
- Limping, altered gait/stroke

**Better to take 3 days off now than 6 weeks later.**

---

## Return from Injury

**Don't rush back:**
1. Pain-free in daily life first
2. Start with 50% previous volume
3. Single discipline first
4. No intensity initially
5. Gradual rebuild over 2-4 weeks
6. Address root cause (form, strength, recovery)

**If pain returns: stop and reassess.**

---

## Bottom Line

**Most triathlon injuries are preventable:**
- Gradual progression
- [[General Principles|Strength training]]
- [[Sleep and Recovery|Adequate recovery]]
- Listen to your body
- Address issues early

**Stay healthy > train harder**

Consistent moderate training >>> aggressive training interrupted by injury.
