# Race Day Execution Strategy

**Success = Preparation + Execution + Avoiding Stupid Mistakes**

---

## Pre-Race Timeline

### Night Before (-18 to -12 hours)

**Bike check:**
- Tires inflated to race pressure
- Chain lubed
- Gears shifting smoothly
- Nutrition/hydration mounted
- Race number on bike (if required)

**Gear check:**
- Lay out everything (use checklist)
- Check trisuit/race kit
- Goggles, cap, wetsuit
- Shoes (run and bike)
- Race belt, number
- Nutrition and hydration

**Dinner:**
- High carb, low fiber, low fat
- Familiar foods only
- Early dinner (6-7 PM)
- Avoid alcohol

**Sleep:**
- Aim for 8+ hours
- Set multiple alarms
- Lay out morning clothes

---

### Morning Of (-4 to -3 hours)

**Wake up:**
- 3-4 hours before race start
- Allows time to eat and digest
- Bathroom routine

**Breakfast:**
- 2-3g carbs per kg bodyweight
- Low fiber, easily digestible
- Example: white toast + honey + banana
- Coffee if usual routine (not the day to try)
- Finish eating 2.5-3h before start

**Final prep:**
- Load car
- Double-check all gear
- Stay calm, minimize stress

---

### Arrival at Venue (-2 hours)

**Park and unload:**
- Arrive early (parking, lines, unexpected issues)
- Bring everything to transition

**Body marking & check-in:**
- Get race number written on arms/legs
- Timing chip pickup
- Rack bike in assigned spot

---

### Transition Setup (-90 to -60 min)

**Set up [[Transition Training|transition area]]:**
- Lay out gear in order
- Bike in easy gear
- Helmet on aerobars (straps open)
- Shoes accessible
- Towel for feet
- Nutrition easily accessible

**Mental walk-through:**
- Visualize T1 and T2
- Know swim exit to bike route
- Know bike in to run exit route

---

### Pre-Race Routine (-60 to -15 min)

**Bathroom:**
- Now. And again later.

**Warm-up:**
- Light jog 10-15 min (get heart rate up)
- Dynamic stretches
- Swim warm-up if allowed:
  - 5-10 min easy swimming
  - Practice sighting
  - 2-3 short pick-ups

**Wetsuit on:**
- 15-20 min before start
- Vaseline on neck, underarms if chafing prone
- Partially zipped until close to start

**Final mental prep:**
- Review race plan
- Stay calm
- Get to start area 5-10 min early

---

## Race Execution

### Swim

**Start:**
- Seed yourself honestly (don't go to front if you're not fast)
- Outside if worried about contact
- More contact at start is inevitable

**First 200-400m: CONTROLLED CHAOS**
- **Don't go out too hard!** (Most common mistake)
- You'll feel crowded and anxious
- Settle into rhythm after first few minutes
- Find feet to draft if possible

**Mid-Swim:**
- Focus on rhythm and efficiency
- Sight every 6-10 strokes (depending on conditions)
- Bilateral breathing helps with sighting/avoiding sun
- If panicked: backstroke or breaststroke for 10 strokes (no shame)

**Final 200m:**
- Pick up effort slightly
- Think about T1 sequence
- Get horizontal in shallow water (don't run too early)

**Common Swim Mistakes:**
- Starting too fast (adrenaline)
- Not sighting enough (swimming extra meters)
- Not drafting (free speed)
- Panicking and going too hard (wastes energy)

---

### T1: Swim to Bike

**Transition:**
- [[Transition Training|Execute practiced sequence]]
- Helmet on BEFORE touching bike
- Don't rush = fumble less
- Run (don't walk) with bike to mount line

**Mount:**
- Mount at mount line (not before!)
- Get into rhythm before pushing hard

---

### Bike

**First 10-15 minutes:**
- **SETTLE IN** (second most common mistake: going too hard)
- Get into aero position
- Find rhythm and cadence (85-95 rpm)
- Let heart rate settle from swim

**Early Bike:**
- Start [[Race Day Nutrition|nutrition]] early (15-20 min in)
- Sip fluids regularly
- Don't chase people (ride YOUR race)

**Mid-Bike:**
- Hold target power/effort
- Regular nutrition (every 15-20 min)
- Stay aero when possible
- Pass safely and legally

**Final 15-20 min:**
- Mentally prepare for run
- Maintain nutrition
- Shift to easier gear before dismount

**Common Bike Mistakes:**
- Starting too hard (blown on run)
- Inadequate nutrition (bonk on run)
- Chasing other riders (ego pacing)
- Forgetting to hydrate

---

### T2: Bike to Run

**Transition:**
- Dismount at line
- Rack bike, helmet off
- [[Transition Training|Execute practiced sequence]]
- Don't rush shoes (better fitted = faster run)

---

### Run

**First 1-2 km: RESIST!**
- **Most important part of the race**
- Legs will feel weird (totally normal)
- Heart rate spikes from bike effort
- **Slow down!** (everyone goes too fast here)
- Find sustainable rhythm

**Early Run:**
- Let legs settle into rhythm
- Continue [[Race Day Nutrition|nutrition]] (gels at aid stations)
- Sip water/sports drink at every aid station
- Don't walk yet (unless planned strategy)

**Mid-Run:**
- Hold effort (pace may drift, that's OK)
- Focus on form (upright, cadence)
- Break into chunks (next aid station, next km)
- Mental mantras if suffering

**Late Run:**
- Pain cave time
- Everyone hurts (not just you)
- Focus on form (don't shuffle)
- Count down distance

**Final stretch:**
- Give what's left
- High five spectators
- Smile for finish line photo

**Common Run Mistakes:**
- Starting WAY too fast off bike
- Not taking nutrition (bonk)
- Walking too early (if not necessary)
- Negative self-talk

---

## Pacing Strategy by Distance

### Sprint Distance
- **Swim:** Hard but controlled
- **Bike:** 90-95% of FTP / hard effort
- **Run:** 10K race pace or slightly faster

### Olympic Distance
- **Swim:** Controlled hard (think threshold)
- **Bike:** 85-90% FTP / [[Intensity|tempo to threshold]]
- **Run:** Slightly slower than 10K pace

### Half Ironman
- **Swim:** Steady (not all-out)
- **Bike:** 75-80% FTP / [[Intensity|upper Z2 to tempo]]
- **Run:** Half marathon pace (not 10K pace!)

**General rule: if you're not sure, go easier early. You can always speed up later (but rarely can salvage a blow-up).**

---

## Mental Strategies

**When it gets hard (it will):**
- Break race into small chunks
- "Just to the next aid station"
- "Just one more km"
- Count breaths, count pedal strokes
- Think about all the [[Loading Week|training you did]]

**Mantras:**
- "This is what I trained for"
- "Stay smooth, stay strong"
- "Everyone hurts, I can hurt too"
- "Finish strong"

---

## Things That Can Go Wrong (And What To Do)

**Goggles kicked off:** Stop, reset, continue
**Flat tire:** Fix it or DNF (carry CO2 and tube!)
**Stomach issues:** Slow down, stop taking nutrition, wait
**Cramps:** Slow down, stretch, hydrate, salt
**Bonk:** You went too hard and/or didn't fuel. Suffer through.
**Mental breakdown:** Walk 1 min, regroup, jog again

**Remember:** Almost everyone has a rough patch. Those who finish are those who keep moving forward.

---

## Post-Race

**Immediately after:**
- Keep moving (light walk)
- Drink and eat (recovery nutrition)
- Find family/friends

**Within 30 min:**
- 1-1.2g carbs per kg bodyweight
- 20-30g protein
- Rehydrate

**That evening:**
- Big meal
- Ice bath or cold shower if very sore (optional)
- Elevate legs
- **[[Sleep and Recovery|Sleep]]**

**Next few days:**
- Complete rest or very easy movement
- Massage (48h after race, not immediately)
- Reflect on what went well and what to improve

---

## Final Thoughts

**Race day is about executing the plan, not making up for missed training.**

- Trust your preparation
- Stick to your plan
- Avoid stupid mistakes
- Suffer when needed
- Enjoy it (you trained hard for this!)

**Nail the basics:**
- Don't start too hard (swim, bike, run)
- Eat and drink on schedule
- Know [[Transition Training|transitions]]
- Execute YOUR race, not someone else's

**Good luck!**
