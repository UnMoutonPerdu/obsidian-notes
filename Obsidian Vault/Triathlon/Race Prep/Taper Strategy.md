## What is Tapering?

Tapering is the **strategic reduction of training load** before a race to maximize freshness while maintaining fitness. The goal: arrive at the start line **rested but sharp**.

**Key principle:** You can't gain fitness in the last 2 weeks, but you can definitely lose freshness.

---

## Taper Duration by Distance

- **Sprint distance:** 5-7 days
- **Olympic distance:** 10-14 days
- **Half Ironman:** 14-21 days
- **Ironman:** 21-28 days

## What to Reduce

### Volume (Most Important)

**Gradual reduction:**
- Week 3 before race: -20-30% volume
- Week 2 before race: -40-50% volume
- Week 1 before race: -60-70% volume
- Last 2 days: minimal volume (just openers)

### Frequency

- **Maintain** training frequency (don't drop to 2x/week suddenly)
- Keep doing all three disciplines
- Shorter sessions, not fewer sessions

### Intensity

**Keep some intensity, but reduce volume:**
- Maintain [[Intensity|intensity zones]] in workouts
- Reduce **duration** of intervals
- Reduce **number** of intervals
- Increase recovery between efforts

## Example Olympic Distance Taper (2 weeks)

### Week -2 (50% volume reduction)

**Monday:**
- Swim: 30 min easy
- Run: 30 min easy

**Tuesday:**
- Bike: 60 min, include 3×5 min @ [[Intensity|Threshold]]

**Wednesday:**
- Swim: 40 min with short CSS efforts

**Thursday:**
- Run: 45 min, include 3×3 min @ 10K pace

**Friday:**
- Bike: 30 min easy spin + Strength (light)

**Saturday:**
- Bike: 90 min @ [[Intensity|Z2]], last 10 min @ race pace
- Run: 15 min easy brick

**Sunday:**
- Run: 60 min with 2×10 min @ marathon pace

**Total:** ~40% of peak week volume

### Week -1 (70% volume reduction)

## Taper Principles

### DO:
- Reduce volume dramatically
- Maintain intensity (shorter efforts)
- Keep training frequency
- Focus on sleep and nutrition
- Practice race pace briefly
- Trust the process (you'll feel sluggish days 3-7)

### DON'T:
- Panic and add "one more hard session"
- Try to "bank" fitness
- Eliminate intensity completely
- Change diet drastically
- Test new gear or nutrition
- Sit completely still (light movement aids recovery)

## The Taper Paradox

**Days 3-7 of taper: you'll feel tired, heavy, sluggish**
- This is **NORMAL**
- Body is in deep recovery mode
- Glycogen stores refilling
- Inflammation decreasing

**Days 1-2 before race: you'll feel bouncy and fresh**
- This is when taper pays off
- Trust the process!

---

## Nutrition During Taper

**Week -2:**
- Maintain normal [[Daily Nutrition|carb intake]]
- Don't reduce just because volume dropped
- Protein stays high

**Week -1:**
- Start increasing carb percentage slightly
- Reduce fiber last 2 days (avoid GI issues)
- Stay hydrated

**Day -1:**
- High carb, low fiber, low fat
- Nothing new or exotic
- Early dinner (good sleep > late meal)

---

## Mental Preparation

Use extra time for:
- Visualizing race execution
- Reviewing race plan
- Checking gear multiple times
- Relaxation and stress management
- Avoiding race anxiety doom-scrolling

**Remember:** The work is done. Taper is about revealing the fitness you've built, not building more fitness.
