## Why Practice Transitions?

Transitions are often called the **"fourth discipline"** in triathlon. You can lose minutes in transition through:
- Forgetting items
- Fumbling with gear
- Poor organization
- Inefficient movements

**T1 and T2 combined can be 5-10% of your total race time!**

## T1: Swim → Bike

### Transition Area Setup

**Bike position:**
- In lowest gear (easy to start)
- Shoes already clipped to pedals (advanced) OR
- Shoes ready beside bike with straps open

**Layout (from bike):**
- Towel (for quick foot dry/wipe)
- Helmet (on aerobars, straps open)
- Sunglasses (in helmet or on bars)
- Nutrition taped to bike
- Race number belt (if required)
- Bike shoes (if not on pedals)

### T1 Sequence

1. **Unzip wetsuit** while running to transition
2. **Pull wetsuit** off arms, then legs (practice this!)
3. **Dry feet** quickly with towel
4. **Put on helmet** (must be clipped before touching bike!)
5. **Sunglasses** on
6. **Shoes** (if wearing them in T1)
7. **Grab bike** and run to mount line
8. **Mount and go!**

**Time target:** 1-2 minutes for age grouper

## T2: Bike → Run

### Transition Area Setup

**Run gear:**
- Running shoes (laces elastic or lock laces)
- Race belt with number
- Hat/visor (optional)
- Nutrition (gels in pockets)

### T2 Sequence

1. **Dismount** before dismount line
2. **Run with bike** to rack position
3. **Rack bike**
4. **Remove helmet** (after bike is racked)
5. **Remove bike shoes** if still on
6. **Put on run shoes** (already loosened)
7. **Race belt** on (number to back, rotate at aid station)
8. **Hat** on (optional)
9. **Grab nutrition** and go!

**Time target:** 45-90 seconds for age grouper

## Practice Protocol

### Brick Workouts with Transitions

**Every 2-3 weeks during build phase:**
1. Short swim or bike warmup
2. **Practice T1 or T2** with full gear
3. Immediately continue with next discipline
4. Focus on smooth, efficient movements

**Example session:**
- 20 min bike @ [[Intensity|Z2]]
- Practice T2 (time yourself)
- 20 min run @ easy pace

### Race Week Rehearsal

**2-3 days before race:**
- Set up full transition area at home
- Walk through T1 and T2 sequences
- Check all gear
- Visualize perfect transitions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Helmet not clipped before touching bike (= disqualification!)
- Forgetting to change from bike to run mode mentally
- Too much stuff in transition (keep it minimal)
- Rushing and fumbling with gear
- Not practicing in training

## Advanced Tips

**Flying mount** (bike shoes on pedals):
- Run alongside bike in bare feet/cycling socks
- Jump on bike while moving
- Get feet into shoes while riding
- Saves 10-20 seconds

**Flying dismount:**
- Take feet out of shoes before dismount line
- Unclip shoes from pedals
- Dismount while rolling
- Run in socks to transition

**Only attempt these after mastering basic transitions!**

## Mental Checklist

**Pre-race visualization:**
- "Helmet on before bike"
- "Smooth, not rushed"
- "What's my first action when I arrive?"
- "Run don't walk"

Practice makes **fast** and **penalty-free**.
