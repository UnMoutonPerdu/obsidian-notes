### Running
- Pace-based zones (see [[Intensity]])
- Heart rate training

---

## Discipline-Specific Skills

---

## Strength & Conditioning

**[[General Principles]] - Philosophy and approach**

### Workout Sets

- [[Set B]] - Upper body focus (Loading weeks)
- [[Set C]] - Light maintenance (Recovery week)

**Frequency:**
- Loading weeks: 2 sessions (Set A + Set B)
- Recovery week: 1 session (Set C)

---

## Nutrition

### Daily Nutrition
- [[Daily Nutrition]] - Macros, timing, hydration

### Race Nutrition

**Key principle: Practice nutrition in training, never try new things on race day.**

---

---

## Testing Protocols

Establish baseline fitness:
- [[FTP Test Protocol]] - Cycling threshold power (every 8-12 weeks)
- [[Critical Swim Speed]] - Swimming threshold pace (every 8-12 weeks)

**When to test:**
- Start of training block
- Every 8-12 weeks
- NOT during recovery week or when fatigued

---

## Equipment

### What You Need
- [[Equipment Guide]] - Essentials vs nice-to-have
- Budget recommendations
- Maintenance schedules

**Key investments:**
1. Good bike fit (prevent injuries)
2. Proper running shoes (replace regularly)
3. Wetsuit (if racing in cold water)
4. Power meter (if serious about training)

---

## Training Philosophy Summary

### Progressive Overload
- Increase volume gradually (10% rule)
- [[Loading Week]] provides stimulus
- [[Recovery Week]] allows adaptation

### Consistency > Intensity
- Better to train moderately and consistently
- Than train hard and get injured
- [[Sleep and Recovery]] is not optional

### Specificity
- Train the demands of your race
- [[Intensity]] matters: practice race efforts
- [[Swim Drills]], [[Open Water Skills]] - technique work pays off

### Listen to Your Body
- [[Common Injuries]] - Address small issues before they become big
- [[Recovery Week]] is mandatory, not optional
- Persistent pain = rest or see professional

---

## Typical Training Week Structure

### Loading Week Example:
**Monday:** Swim (easy) + Run (easy) + Strength ([[Set A]] or [[Set B]])
**Tuesday:** Bike (quality/intervals)
**Wednesday:** Swim (aerobic) + Run (easy)
**Thursday:** Run (quality/intervals) + optional easy bike
**Friday:** Swim (easy) + Strength ([[Set A]] or [[Set B]])
**Saturday:** Long bike + optional swim
**Sunday:** Long run

**Total:** ~750-850 TSS, 2 hard sessions (one bike, one run)

### Recovery Week Example:
**Monday:** Swim (easy) + Strength ([[Set C]])
**Tuesday:** Bike (aerobic, no intensity)
**Wednesday:** Swim (easy) + Run (easy)
**Thursday:** Run (short controlled intensity)
**Friday:** Off or easy swim
**Saturday:** Bike (short endurance)
**Sunday:** Run (short long run)

**Total:** ~450-550 TSS, -40% volume, minimal intensity

---

## Progressive Training Block Example

**Weeks 1-3:** [[Loading Week]]
- Progressive volume increase (week 3 highest)
- Maintain 2 quality sessions per week
- Include strength work ([[Set A]] + [[Set B]])

**Week 4:** [[Recovery Week]]
- -40% volume
- Minimal intensity
- Light strength work ([[Set C]])
- Absorb adaptations

**Weeks 5-7:** Loading (higher baseline than weeks 1-3)
**Week 8:** Recovery

**Weeks 9-11:** Loading (highest volume/intensity)
**Week 12:** Recovery

**Weeks 13-15:** [[Taper Strategy]] (if racing)

---

## Key Principles (Remember These!)

1. **Volume before intensity**
   - Build aerobic base first
   - Add quality work later
   - [[Training Stress Score]] increases non-linearly with intensity

2. **Recovery is when you get faster**
   - Training = stimulus
   - [[Recovery Week]] = adaptation
   - [[Sleep and Recovery]] = #1 priority

3. **Consistency beats heroics**
   - 10 hours/week for 12 weeks > 15 hours/week for 6 weeks then injured
   - [[Common Injuries]] - Prevention > treatment

4. **Train with purpose**
   - Every session has a goal
   - Easy days easy, hard days hard
   - [[Intensity]] zones matter

5. **Test and adjust**
   - [[FTP Test Protocol]] every 8-12 weeks
   - [[Critical Swim Speed]] every 8-12 weeks
   - Update zones based on fitness

6. **Practice what you'll race**
   - [[Open Water Skills]] - not optional
   - [[Transition Training]] - saves minutes
   - [[Race Day Nutrition]] - test in training
   - [[Race Day Execution]] - visualize and practice
