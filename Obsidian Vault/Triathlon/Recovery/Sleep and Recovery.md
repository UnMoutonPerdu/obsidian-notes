## Why Sleep is Non-Negotiable

**Sleep is when you get faster.** Training provides the stimulus; sleep is where adaptation happens.

Poor sleep = poor recovery = poor performance = increased injury risk

## Sleep Targets for Triathletes

**Base requirement:**
- Most adults: 7-9 hours
- Heavy training load: **8-10 hours**
- During [[Loading Week]]: aim for upper range
- During [[Recovery Week]]: body may need even more (deep adaptation)

**Sleep debt is real:**
- Can't be fully "caught up" on weekends
- Accumulates over time
- Impacts performance more than most realize

---

## Sleep Quality > Sleep Quantity

### Optimize Sleep Environment

**Temperature:**
- Cool room: 15-19°C (60-67°F)
- Cold room = better deep sleep

**Darkness:**
- Complete darkness
- Blackout curtains or sleep mask
- No LED lights, phone screens

**Quiet:**
- Earplugs if needed
- White noise machine (optional)

**Mattress & Pillow:**
- Invest in quality
- Replace every 7-10 years

## Sleep Routine for Athletes

### Evening Protocol (Last 2-3 hours before bed)

**DO:**
- Dim lights in house
- Light stretching or foam rolling
- Read, listen to calm music
- Cool shower (counterintuitively helps sleep)
- Herbal tea (chamomile, valerian)
- Write tomorrow's plan (clears mind)

**DON'T:**
- Bright screens (or use blue light filters)
- Large meals (finish eating 3h before bed)
- Alcohol (destroys sleep quality even if you "fall asleep")
- Intense discussions or work
- Late training sessions (finish 3-4h before bed)

### Morning Protocol

**Consistent wake time:**
- Even on weekends (±30 min)
- Helps regulate circadian rhythm
- Get sunlight exposure within 30 min of waking

---

## Caffeine Strategy

**Caffeine half-life: 5-6 hours**

- Last coffee by 2-3 PM if bedtime is 10 PM
- Some athletes: cut off by noon
- Monitor your sensitivity
- Don't rely on caffeine to mask poor sleep

---

## Naps for Triathletes

**Strategic napping can help:**

**Short power nap (20-30 min):**
- Increases alertness
- Doesn't cause grogginess
- Best timing: early afternoon (1-3 PM)

**Longer nap (90 min):**
- Full sleep cycle
- Beneficial during very high training load
- Harder to fit into schedule

**DON'T:**
- Nap after 4 PM (disrupts night sleep)
- Nap for 45-60 min (wakes during deep sleep = grogginess)

---

## Recovery Indicators

### Signs of Good Recovery

- Rested feeling upon waking
- Stable mood
- Normal appetite
- Looking forward to training
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV) normal or trending up
- Resting heart rate normal

### Signs of Poor Recovery

- Difficulty falling/staying asleep
- Waking up tired despite 8+ hours
- Irritability, mood swings
- Elevated resting heart rate (>5 bpm above normal)
- Decreased HRV
- Persistent muscle soreness
- Loss of appetite or excessive hunger
- Getting sick frequently

**If you have multiple signs:** Take an extra rest day or make next day very easy.

## Other Recovery Strategies

### Active Recovery

**Light movement aids recovery:**
- Easy 20-30 min spin
- Easy 20-30 min swim
- Walking
- Yoga, stretching

**Zone 1 only!** If you're breathing hard, it's not recovery.

### Passive Recovery

**Foam rolling / Massage:**
- 10-15 min daily
- Focus on problem areas
- Not a substitute for sleep

**Compression gear:**
- Some athletes swear by it
- Evidence is mixed
- Won't hurt, might help

**Ice baths / Contrast therapy:**
- May reduce soreness perception
- Potentially blunts adaptation if overused
- Use sparingly, mainly before races

**Prioritize sleep over gadgets and gimmicks.**

---

## Alcohol and Recovery

**The hard truth:**
- Disrupts sleep architecture (less REM and deep sleep)
- Impairs protein synthesis
- Dehydrates
- Impacts glycogen replenishment
- Increases inflammation

**If you drink:**
- Limit to 1-2 drinks max
- Not on hard training days
- Not during peak training blocks
- Rehydrate thoroughly

**Best for performance: minimize or eliminate during serious training.**

---

## Travel and Sleep

**Jet lag strategies:**
- Adjust sleep schedule 2-3 days before
- Get sunlight at destination
- Melatonin (0.5-3mg) can help reset
- Stay hydrated on flight
- Avoid alcohol on plane

---

## Bottom Line

**Training + Sleep + Nutrition = Adaptation**

Remove one leg of the stool and you fall over.

If you had to choose between:
- 2 extra training hours per week with poor sleep
- Proper sleep with less training

**Choose sleep. Every time.**
