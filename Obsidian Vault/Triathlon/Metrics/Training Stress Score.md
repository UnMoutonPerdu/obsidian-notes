# Training Stress Score (TSS)

**TSS** is a way to quantify training load from a single session. It represents the physiological impact of a workout, taking into account both duration and intensity.

Originally designed for cycling with power meters, variants exist for running (rTSS) and swimming (sTSS).

---

## Why TSS Matters

**TSS** is the product of duration and intensity **squared**! This non-linear relationship means:
- Doubling duration = doubles TSS
- Doubling intensity = **quadruples** TSS

**This is why it's important to build volume first, then add intensity.** Adding high-intensity intervals dramatically increases training stress.

---

## The Formula

### Full Formula:
$$TSS = \frac{(duration \times NP \times IF)}{FTP \times 3600} \times 100$$

Where:
- $duration$ = workout duration in seconds
- $NP$ = [[Normalized Power]]
- $IF$ = [[Intensity Factor]]
- $FTP$ = Functional Threshold Power

### Simplified Formula (easier to remember):
$$TSS \approx IF^2 \times Duration_{hours} \times 100$$

**By definition:** 1 hour at FTP (IF = 1.0) = 100 TSS

---

## Practical Workout Examples

### Example 1: Easy Endurance Ride
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Intensity:** 65% FTP (IF = 0.65)
- **TSS:** 0.65² × 2 × 100 = **85 TSS**

### Example 2: Sweet Spot Intervals
- **Duration:** 90 minutes (1.5 hours)
- **Main set:** 3×12 min @ 88% FTP
- **Overall IF:** ≈ 0.80
- **TSS:** 0.80² × 1.5 × 100 = **96 TSS**

### Example 3: VO₂max Session
- **Duration:** 60 minutes (1 hour)
- **Main set:** 5×5 min @ 115% FTP
- **Overall IF:** ≈ 0.90 (includes recovery between intervals)
- **TSS:** 0.90² × 1 × 100 = **81 TSS**

**Notice:** The VO₂max session is shorter but very intense. High IF = high training stress!

### Example 4: Long Steady Ride
- **Duration:** 3 hours
- **Intensity:** 70% FTP (IF = 0.70)
- **TSS:** 0.70² × 3 × 100 = **147 TSS**

## TSS and Recovery

The following values help understand how TSS should feel. **Individual variation exists!**

- **TSS ≤ 150** – Low (recovery generally complete by following day)
- **150-300** – Medium (some residual fatigue next day, gone by day 2)
- **300-450** – High (residual fatigue may last 2+ days)
- **TSS ≥ 450** – Very high (residual fatigue lasting several days likely)

**Examples:**
- Easy 90-min spin: ~60 TSS
- Hard 90-min workout: ~120 TSS
- 4-hour endurance ride: ~200 TSS
- Century ride (100 miles): ~300-400 TSS
- Ironman bike leg: ~280-320 TSS

## Weekly TSS Targets

**Beginner triathlete:** 300-500 TSS/week
**Intermediate:** 500-800 TSS/week
**Advanced:** 800-1200+ TSS/week
**Elite/Pro:** 1200-1500+ TSS/week

### Training Block Structure

**During [[Loading Week]]:**
- Target: ~750-850 TSS/week
- Build fitness through accumulated stress

**During [[Recovery Week]]:**
- Target: ~450-550 TSS/week (-40%)
- Allow body to absorb and adapt

**Important:** Increase weekly TSS by maximum **10% per week** to avoid overtraining and injury.

## TSS for Running (rTSS)

Running TSS is estimated from pace and heart rate relative to threshold:

**Typical rTSS per hour:**
- **Easy run (Z1-Z2):** 30-50 TSS/hour
- **Tempo run (Z3):** 60-80 TSS/hour
- **Threshold run (Z4):** 80-100 TSS/hour
- **Interval run (Z5):** 70-100+ TSS/hour

**Example run workouts:**
- 60-min easy run: ~40 rTSS
- 75-min with 3×15' @ marathon pace: ~75 rTSS
- 60-min with 5×5' @ VO₂max: ~80 rTSS

Most platforms (Garmin, TrainingPeaks, Strava) calculate rTSS automatically from pace/heart rate data.

**Note:** rTSS is less precise than bike TSS (power-based) but useful for tracking training load.

---

## TSS for Swimming (sTSS)

Swimming TSS is estimated from pace relative to [[Critical Swim Speed|CSS]]:

**Typical sTSS per hour:**
- **Easy swim (CSS + 15s):** 40-60 TSS/hour
- **Endurance swim (CSS + 10s):** 60-80 TSS/hour
- **Threshold swim (CSS ± 2s):** 80-100 TSS/hour
- **Interval swim (CSS - 5s):** 80-100+ TSS/hour

**Example swim workouts:**
- 45-min easy technique: ~30 sTSS
- 60-min aerobic endurance: ~65 sTSS
- 50-min with CSS intervals: ~75 sTSS

**Note:** sTSS is the least precise of the three but helps track overall training load across all disciplines.

---

## Using TSS for Training Management

### 1. Track Weekly Load
Monitor total TSS (bike + run + swim) weekly:
- Consistent TSS week-to-week = maintaining fitness
- Increasing TSS = building fitness
- Decreasing TSS = tapering or recovering

### 2. Balance Intensity and Volume
- High TSS from volume (long, steady) = aerobic base
- High TSS from intensity (short, hard) = specific fitness
- Need both, but **build volume first**

### 3. Plan Recovery
- 3 weeks building TSS (progressive load)
- 1 week reduced TSS ([[Recovery Week]])
- Pattern: 750 → 800 → 850 → 500 (TSS)

### 4. Avoid Overtraining
**Warning signs:**
- Weekly TSS increase >10%/week
- Multiple weeks >450 TSS without recovery
- Accumulating fatigue despite rest days

**Solution:** Schedule [[Recovery Week]] immediately

---

## TSS Limitations

**TSS doesn't account for:**
- Current fatigue state
- Life stress (work, sleep, nutrition)
- Environmental factors (heat, altitude, wind)
- Individual recovery capacity
- Muscular vs cardiovascular stress

**Example:** 200 TSS feels easy when fresh, devastating when fatigued or sick.

**Use TSS as a guide, not an absolute rule.** Listen to your body and adjust based on how you feel.

---

## Relationship to Other Metrics

**TSS is calculated from:**
- [[Normalized Power]] (NP) - captures physiological cost
- [[Intensity Factor]] (IF) - shows relative intensity
- Duration - time under stress

**Formula reminder:**
$$TSS = IF^2 \times Duration_{hours} \times 100$$

This shows why **intensity matters so much**:
- IF 0.70 for 2h = 98 TSS
- IF 0.85 for 2h = 145 TSS (+48% more stress!)

---

## Practical Application

**Before workout:** Plan target TSS based on session goal
**After workout:** Review actual TSS vs planned
**Weekly:** Sum total TSS, ensure progressive load with recovery weeks
**Monthly:** Track TSS trends to monitor fitness trajectory

**Example weekly breakdown ([[Loading Week]]):**
- Monday: 75 TSS (swim + easy run + strength)
- Tuesday: 120 TSS (hard bike)
- Wednesday: 85 TSS (swim + easy run)
- Thursday: 110 TSS (hard run + easy bike)
- Friday: 70 TSS (easy swim + strength)
- Saturday: 160 TSS (long bike)
- Sunday: 130 TSS (long run)
- **Total: ~750 TSS**
