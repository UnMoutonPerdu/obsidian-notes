### TSS - Accurate for bike workouts
**TSS** is a way to represent training work load from a training session. It is intended to represent the impact of a cycling session, but some variant allows computation for running and swimming sessions. 

**TSS** is the product of the duration by the intensity **squared**! That's why it is important to increase and practice volume first, and add intensity after. Adding optional intensities inside workouts increase a lot this **TSS**.
The formula is the following:
$$TSS = \frac{(duration \times NP \times IF)}{FTP \times 3600} \times 100$$
- $duration \rightarrow$ duration of the workout in seconds
- $NP \rightarrow$ Normalized Power
- $IF \rightarrow$ Intensity Factor
- $FTP \rightarrow$ Functional Threshold Power

The following values help to understand how TSS should feel. Be aware that those values can vary a lot from one individual to another one!
- $TSS \leq 150$ – low (recovery generally complete by following day)
- 150-300 – medium (some residual fatigue may be present the next day, but gone by 2nd day)
- 300-450 – high (some residual fatigue may be present even after 2 days)
- $TSS \geq 450$ – very high (residual fatigue lasting several days likely)
