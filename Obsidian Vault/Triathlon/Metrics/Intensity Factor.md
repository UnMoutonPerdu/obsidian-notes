# Intensity Factor (IF)

$$IF = \frac{NP}{FTP}$$

Where:
- **NP** is the [[Normalized Power]]
- **FTP** is the Functional Threshold Power

**IF tells you how hard a workout was relative to your current fitness.**

By definition:
- Riding at FTP for any duration = IF of 1.00
- IF of 0.70 = riding at 70% of FTP
- IF of 1.15 = riding at 115% of FTP

---

## Why IF Matters

IF provides a **normalized measure of intensity** that accounts for:
- Your current fitness level (via FTP)
- Power variability during the workout (via NP)

**Two athletes with different FTP can compare workout intensity using IF.**

**Example:**
- Athlete A: FTP 300W, rides at 240W → IF = 0.80
- Athlete B: FTP 200W, rides at 160W → IF = 0.80
- **Same relative intensity** despite different absolute power!

---

## IF Ranges by Workout Type

### Recovery Rides
**IF: 0.50-0.65**
- Very easy spinning
- Conversational pace
- Should feel refreshing, not tiring
- Purpose: active recovery, flush legs

**Example workout:**
- 60 min easy spin
- NP 140W, FTP 250W
- IF = 140/250 = **0.56** ✓ Good recovery

---

### Endurance / Aerobic Rides
**IF: 0.65-0.75**
- [[Intensity|Z2]] riding
- Sustainable for 3-5+ hours
- Base building work
- Comfortable but purposeful

**Example workout:**
- 3-hour endurance ride
- NP 175W, FTP 250W
- IF = 175/250 = **0.70** ✓ Solid aerobic work

---

### Tempo / Sweet Spot
**IF: 0.75-0.90**
- [[Intensity|Tempo and sweet spot zones]]
- Sustainable for 60-120 minutes
- High training value (builds FTP)
- Uncomfortably comfortable

**Example workout:**
- 90 min with 3×12' @ sweet spot
- NP 220W, FTP 250W
- IF = 220/250 = **0.88** ✓ Quality training stimulus

---

### Threshold Workouts
**IF: 0.85-0.95**
- Near or at FTP
- Very hard, 20-60 minute efforts
- Used for [[FTP Test Protocol|testing]] and specific intervals
- Sustainable but requires mental focus

**Example workout:**
- 60 min with 2×20' @ threshold
- NP 235W, FTP 250W
- IF = 235/250 = **0.94** ✓ True threshold work

---

### VO₂max Intervals
**IF: 0.90-1.05+**
- Short hard intervals (3-8 minutes)
- Overall workout IF high despite recovery periods
- Not sustainable for extended duration
- Builds top-end power

**Example workout:**
- 60 min with 5×5' @ 115% FTP
- NP 240W, FTP 250W
- IF = 240/250 = **0.96** ✓ Hard VO₂ session

**Note:** IF is high even with recovery valleys because [[Normalized Power|NP]] weights the hard efforts heavily.

---

## Race IF Targets

### Sprint Distance Triathlon
**Target IF: 0.90-1.00**
- Very hard effort
- 20-30 minute bike leg
- Can sustain high intensity
- Still need to run after!

**Pacing tip:** Don't exceed IF 1.05 or you'll blow up on the run.

---

### Olympic Distance Triathlon
**Target IF: 0.85-0.92**
- Hard but controlled effort
- 40-60 minute bike leg
- Balance speed with sustainability
- Must preserve legs for 10K run

**Pacing tip:** IF > 0.95 = almost certainly too hard, will suffer on run.

---

### Half Ironman (70.3)
**Target IF: 0.75-0.82**
- Upper [[Intensity|Z2]] to tempo effort
- 2.5-3.5 hour bike leg
- Sustainable power crucial
- Half marathon run ahead

**Pacing tip:** IF > 0.85 = too aggressive, will bonk on run.

---

### Ironman (140.6)
**Target IF: 0.68-0.75**
- Mostly [[Intensity|Z2]] effort
- 4.5-7 hour bike leg
- Conservation is key
- Marathon run ahead

**Pacing tip:** IF > 0.78 = recipe for disaster on the run.

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Easy Recovery Ride
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **NP:** 150W
- **FTP:** 250W
- **IF:** 150/250 = **0.60**
- **Assessment:** ✓ Perfect recovery intensity

---

### Example 2: Sweet Spot Training
- **Duration:** 90 minutes
- **NP:** 220W
- **FTP:** 250W
- **IF:** 220/250 = **0.88**
- **Assessment:** ✓ Excellent training stimulus, builds FTP

---

### Example 3: Failed Race Pacing
- **Race:** Olympic distance triathlon
- **Duration:** 60 minutes (bike leg)
- **NP:** 240W
- **FTP:** 250W
- **IF:** 240/250 = **0.96**
- **Assessment:** ✗ Way too hard! Will destroy the run.

**What happened:** Athlete went out too hard, likely got caught up in race excitement. Paid for it dearly on the 10K run.

**Better pacing:** Target IF 0.88 (NP 220W) would have been sustainable and led to better overall time.

---

### Example 4: Perfect Half Ironman Execution
- **Duration:** 3 hours (bike leg)
- **NP:** 195W
- **FTP:** 250W
- **IF:** 195/250 = **0.78**
- **Assessment:** ✓ Well-paced, strong run followed

---

## Relationship to TSS

**IF and [[Training Stress Score|TSS]] are mathematically linked:**

$$TSS = IF^2 \times Duration_{hours} \times 100$$

This relationship reveals something critical:

**Doubling IF quadruples TSS per hour!**

### Examples:

**Easy 2-hour ride:**
- IF = 0.70
- TSS = 0.70² × 2 × 100 = **98 TSS**

**Hard 2-hour ride:**
- IF = 0.85
- TSS = 0.85² × 2 × 100 = **145 TSS** (+48% more training stress!)

**This is why intensity matters so much for training load.**

You can add 50% more training stress **without adding any more time** just by increasing intensity.

**Corollary:** This is also why adding intensity to high-volume weeks is risky. You can easily spike weekly TSS beyond recovery capacity.

## IF and Sustainability

**How long can you sustain different IF levels?**

| IF Range | Sustainable Duration | Example |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| 0.50-0.65 | Indefinite | Recovery ride |
| 0.65-0.75 | 4-6+ hours | Ironman bike, long endurance |
| 0.75-0.85 | 2-4 hours | Half Ironman bike, tempo ride |
| 0.85-0.95 | 45-90 min | Olympic tri bike, threshold work |
| 0.95-1.05 | 20-45 min | Sprint tri bike, FTP test |
| 1.05-1.15 | 10-20 min | VO₂max intervals (with recovery) |
| > 1.15 | < 10 min | Short intervals, race finish |

**Important:** These are general guidelines. Individual variation exists based on:
- Training history
- Fatigue state
- Environmental conditions (heat, wind)
- Whether running follows (triathlon)

---

## Using IF in Training

### 1. Plan Target Intensity

**Before workout, set target IF based on goal:**
- Recovery day → IF 0.55-0.65
- Endurance day → IF 0.68-0.72
- Tempo day → IF 0.80-0.88
- Threshold day → IF 0.90-0.98

### 2. Monitor During Workout

**Glance at IF on bike computer:**
- Too low? Increase effort slightly
- Too high? Reign it in
- Helps maintain target intensity

**Particularly useful for:**
- Race pacing (stay on target IF)
- Long steady rides (avoid drifting too easy or hard)

### 3. Analyze After Workout

**Review IF to assess execution:**
- Hit target IF? ✓ Well executed
- Too high? Went too hard (accidental or intentional)
- Too low? Not enough effort (or overly fatigued)

### 4. Track Trends Over Time

**As fitness improves:**
- Same IF = easier perceived effort
- Same perceived effort = higher IF possible
- IF at lactate threshold stays at 1.00 (by definition), but wattage increases

## Common IF Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring IF on Easy Days
**Problem:** "It's just a recovery ride, I don't need to check."

**Result:** IF drifts to 0.75-0.80, defeating recovery purpose.

**Solution:** Actively monitor IF, keep it 0.50-0.65 even if it feels "too easy."

---

### Mistake 2: Racing at Unsustainable IF
**Problem:** Going out too hard in triathlon because you "feel good."

**Result:** IF 0.95+ on Olympic distance, death march on the run.

**Solution:** Pre-race plan target IF, stick to it religiously first half of bike.

---

### Mistake 3: Comparing IF Between Athletes
**Problem:** "My training partner rides at IF 0.85, so I should too."

**Result:** Overtraining or undertraining depending on your fitness vs. theirs.

**Solution:** IF is relative to **your** FTP. Focus on your own targets, not others.

---

### Mistake 4: Not Updating FTP
**Problem:** FTP set 6 months ago, fitness has changed significantly.

**Result:** IF calculations are wrong, training zones are wrong.

**Solution:** [[FTP Test Protocol|Test FTP]] every 8-12 weeks, update zones promptly.

---

## IF Doesn't Account For

**IF is excellent but has limitations:**

1. **Current fatigue level** - IF 0.80 feels easy when fresh, brutal when fatigued
2. **Environmental factors** - Heat, wind, altitude all affect perceived effort at same IF
3. **Nutrition/hydration state** - Bonking makes any IF feel impossible
4. **Life stress** - Work stress, poor sleep, illness all affect how IF feels
5. **Terrain** - Hilly IF 0.80 feels harder than flat IF 0.80 (even though [[Normalized Power|NP/VI]] account for this)

**Use IF as a guide, but always listen to your body.**

---

## Advanced: Decoupling

**In long rides/races, watch for "cardiac drift" or "decoupling":**

**Normal:** Power stays steady, heart rate stays steady → IF stable
**Decoupling:** Power stays steady, heart rate creeps up → aerobic system struggling

**Example Half Ironman:**
- First 90 min: IF 0.78, HR 145 bpm
- Second 90 min: IF 0.78, HR 155 bpm

**This indicates:**
- Dehydration
- Glycogen depletion
- Heat stress
- IF was too high for your current fitness/conditions

**Training goal:** Build endurance so you can hold target IF with minimal cardiac drift.

## Summary

**Intensity Factor is one of the most useful training metrics:**

1. **Normalizes intensity** across athletes and fitness levels
2. **Predicts sustainability** for different durations
3. **Guides pacing** in races and training
4. **Calculates [[Training Stress Score|TSS]]** accurately
5. **Simple to understand** (percent of FTP)

**The formula:**
$$IF = \frac{NP}{FTP}$$

**The key insight:**
$$TSS = IF^2 \times Duration_{hours} \times 100$$

**Intensity matters more than you think. Small increases in IF create large increases in training stress.**

**Master IF, and you master pacing.**
