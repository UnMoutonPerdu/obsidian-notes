It helps to understand how hard was a workout according your current fitness level. 
Of course it doesn't take into account your current fatigue level, the weather during which you made your workout, etc... It only represents the difficulty of a workout according your fitness/FTP. For instance, a recovery bike should have an IF around 0.55-0.6. But for various factors (weather, fatigue, stress, ...) even this workout can seem difficult!
