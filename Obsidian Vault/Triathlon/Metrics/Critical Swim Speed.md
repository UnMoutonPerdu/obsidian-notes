**CSS** (Critical Swim Speed) is the swimming equivalent of FTP for cycling. It represents the pace you can theoretically sustain for a long duration (~30-60 minutes).

## How to Test CSS

**Standard CSS Test:**
1. Warm up 400-600m
2. Swim 400m **all-out** (record time T400)
3. Rest 4-5 minutes
4. Swim 200m **all-out** (record time T200)
5. Cool down

**Formula:**
$$CSS = \frac{200m}{T400 - T200}$$

Result is in **m/s** or can be converted to **pace per 100m**:
$$Pace_{100m} = \frac{100}{CSS}$$

## CSS-Based Training Zones

- **Z1 Recovery:** CSS + 20-25s per 100m
- **Z2 Aerobic/Endurance:** CSS + 10-15s per 100m
- **Z3 Tempo:** CSS + 5-8s per 100m
- **Z4 Threshold:** CSS ± 2s per 100m
- **Z5 VO₂max:** CSS - 5-10s per 100m

## When to Retest

- Every 8-12 weeks
- After significant training block
- Beginning of new season
- When CSS-based workouts feel too easy/hard

**Note:** CSS tends to be slightly faster than your Olympic distance race pace and slower than your sprint distance race pace.
