**TSB** represents your current **form** or **freshness** — the balance between fitness and fatigue.

---

## The Concept

Think of TSB as the **net result** of your training:
- **Positive TSB:** More fresh than fatigued (ready to perform)
- **Negative TSB:** More fatigued than fresh (need recovery)
- **Zero TSB:** Balanced (fitness = fatigue)

TSB is the simplest metric in the Performance Management Chart (PMC), but arguably the most important for **predicting race-day readiness**.

---

## The Formula

$$TSB = CTL - ATL$$

Where:
- **[[Chronic Training Load|CTL]]** = Chronic Training Load (fitness)
- **[[Acute Training Load|ATL]]** = Acute Training Load (fatigue)

**That's it. Simple subtraction.**

**Why this works:**
- High fitness, low fatigue = positive TSB (fresh and fit!)
- High fitness, high fatigue = negative TSB (trained but tired)
- Low fitness, low fatigue = positive TSB (fresh but unfit)

**For racing, you want high CTL (fitness) and low ATL (fatigue) → large positive TSB.**

---

## TSB Interpretation

### Positive TSB (Fresh)

**TSB = +5 to +25:**
- Well-rested
- Ready for hard training or racing
- Optimal zone for B/C races
- Can push intensity

**TSB = +25 to +50:**
- Very fresh
- Peak readiness for A race
- Ideal zone for racing
- Might feel "springy" and energetic

**TSB > +50:**
- Extremely fresh
- Risk of feeling "stale" for some athletes
- Too long without training stimulus
- Most athletes still perform well

---

### Zero TSB (Balanced)

**TSB = -5 to +5:**
- Fitness and fatigue balanced
- Maintenance mode
- Can train but not peak performance
- Typical during transition periods

---

### Negative TSB (Fatigued)

**TSB = -10 to -30:**
- Productive training zone
- Building fitness through overload
- Typical during [[Loading Week]]
- Manageable fatigue

**TSB = -30 to -50:**
- High training load
- Significant fatigue accumulation
- Can sustain for 2-3 weeks max
- Need [[Recovery Week]] soon

**TSB < -50:**
- Very high fatigue
- Overreaching territory
- Risk of overtraining if sustained
- Immediate recovery needed

---

## TSB Through Training Phases

### Base/Build Phase

**Target: Negative TSB**

Goal is to accumulate training stress to build fitness.

**Typical pattern:**
- Week 1-3: TSB gradually becomes more negative
- Week 4: Recovery week, TSB rises toward zero

**Example 3-week build:**
- Week 1 start: TSB = -15
- Week 1 end: TSB = -22
- Week 2 end: TSB = -28
- Week 3 end: TSB = -35 (peak fatigue)
- Week 4 (recovery) end: TSB = -10 (recovered)

**Visual pattern:**
```
TSB
  0 ─────────────────────────────────
    \     /       /        /     /
-10  \   /       /        /     /
      \ /       /        /     /
-20    X       /        /     /
      / \     /        /     /
-30  /   \   /        /     /
    /     \ /        /     /
-40       X         /     /
         / \       /     /
        /   \     /     /
   [Wk1][Wk2][Wk3][Rec]
```

**Key insight:** TSB becomes more negative as you train hard, then rebounds during recovery week.

---

### Recovery Week

**Target: TSB rises significantly**

**Entering recovery week:** TSB = -30 to -40
**Exiting recovery week:** TSB = -5 to -15

**What happens:**
- Training volume drops dramatically
- [[Acute Training Load|ATL]] drops fast (7-day average)
- [[Chronic Training Load|CTL]] drops slightly (42-day average)
- TSB = CTL - ATL increases (less negative or becomes positive)

**Example:**
- Start of recovery week: CTL 85, ATL 110 → TSB = -25
- End of recovery week: CTL 82, ATL 65 → TSB = +17

**TSB improvement: -25 → +17 = +42 point swing!**

This is why recovery weeks work: fatigue drops much faster than fitness.

---

### Peak Week

**Target: Most negative TSB of training cycle**

1-2 weeks before taper, you push training load highest.

**Example peak week:**
- CTL: 105
- ATL: 145
- TSB: -40

**This is intentional overreaching:**
- Very high training load
- Significant fatigue
- Cannot sustain, but don't need to
- Taper begins immediately after

**Warning:** TSB below -50 is risky. Even -40 should only be held 1 week max.

---

### Taper Period

**Target: TSB becomes increasingly positive**

**Goal:** Shed fatigue (ATL) while maintaining fitness (CTL).

**Example 2-week taper:**

**3 weeks before race (peak week):**
- CTL: 105, ATL: 140, TSB: **-35**

**2 weeks before race:**
- CTL: 102, ATL: 95, TSB: **+7**

**1 week before race:**
- CTL: 98, ATL: 60, TSB: **+38**

**Race day:**
- CTL: 95, ATL: 35, TSB: **+60**

**TSB progression: -35 → +7 → +38 → +60**

**Visual:**
```
TSB
+60 ─────────────────────────────●  RACE!
                              ↗
+40                       ↗
                      ↗
+20                ↗
                ↗
  0 ─────────↗
           /
-20      /
       /
-40  ●
   [Peak][Taper1][Taper2][Race]
```

**This is the taper magic:** TSB goes from deeply negative to strongly positive as you shed fatigue faster than fitness decays.

---

## Optimal TSB for Racing

### By Race Distance

**Sprint Triathlon:**
- Target TSB: **+10 to +25**
- Can race on less rest
- Short duration, high intensity

**Olympic Triathlon:**
- Target TSB: **+15 to +30**
- Need good freshness
- Balance speed and endurance

**Half Ironman (70.3):**
- Target TSB: **+20 to +35**
- Longer duration needs more freshness
- Fatigue compounds over 4-6 hours

**Ironman (140.6):**
- Target TSB: **+20 to +40**
- Ultra-endurance demands peak freshness
- Any residual fatigue amplifies over 9-16 hours

**Rule of thumb:** Longer races need higher positive TSB.

### By Race Priority

**A-Race (highest priority):**
- Target TSB: **+20 to +40**
- Full taper
- Peak performance goal

**B-Race (moderate priority):**
- Target TSB: **+5 to +20**
- Short taper (3-7 days)
- Good performance, not peak

**C-Race (low priority / training race):**
- Target TSB: **-10 to +10**
- Minimal or no taper
- Training through the race

---

## TSB and Performance

### The Performance Curve

Research and experience show:

**TSB too negative (<-30):**
- Fatigued, performance impaired
- Can't access top end
- Slower times despite fitness

**TSB slightly negative (-10 to 0):**
- Training residue present
- Performance good but not peak
- Fine for training races

**TSB positive (+10 to +30):**
- **Optimal performance zone**
- Fresh enough to perform
- Fitness still high
- Peak performance likely

**TSB very positive (>+40):**
- Very fresh
- Most athletes perform well
- Some athletes report feeling "flat" or "stale" (rare)

**Individual variability exists!** Some athletes:
- Race best at TSB +15
- Others at TSB +35
- Track your personal data

---

## TSB Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Racing on Negative TSB

**Problem:** Insufficient taper, race on TSB -15.

**Result:** Performance limited by fatigue, not fitness.

**Example:**
- Athlete has CTL 100 (excellent fitness!)
- Races with ATL 115, TSB -15
- Struggles in race, feels heavy
- "I trained so hard, why was I slow?"

**Answer:** Trained hard, but didn't rest hard. Fatigue masked fitness.

**Solution:** Proper [[Taper Strategy]], target TSB +20 to +30.

---

### Mistake 2: Too Much Freshness

**Problem:** Over-tapering, TSB > +60 for non-elite.

**Result:** Most athletes fine, but some feel "stale."

**Less common problem** than racing fatigued, but can happen with:
- Overly long taper (>3 weeks for shorter races)
- Too little training stimulus during taper
- Athlete who responds poorly to lots of rest

**Solution:** Practice taper length in training cycle, find your optimal TSB.

---

### Mistake 3: Chronic Negative TSB

**Problem:** TSB negative for 6+ weeks without recovery.

**Result:** Overtraining, illness, injury.

**Example:**
- Week 1: TSB -20
- Week 2: TSB -25
- Week 3: TSB -32
- Week 4: TSB -38
- Week 5: TSB -45
- Week 6: TSB -50
- Week 7: Gets sick / injured

**Prevention:** Include [[Recovery Week]] every 3-4 weeks to bring TSB back up.

---

### Mistake 4: Too Much Freshness in Training

**Problem:** Staying at TSB +10 to +20 during build phase.

**Result:** Not enough training stress, fitness stagnates.

**Example:**
- Athlete afraid of fatigue
- Keeps training light to feel good
- TSB stays +5 to +15
- CTL flat or declining

**Solution:** Embrace negative TSB during build (productive discomfort). Save freshness for race.

## TSB Patterns to Watch

### Pattern 1: The Saw Tooth (Ideal)

```
TSB
  0 ────────────────────────
      ↘  ↗  ↘  ↗  ↘  ↗
-10       X       X      X
      ↙  ↖  ↙  ↖  ↙  ↖
-20   X       X      X
     [3 weeks loading + 1 recovery repeated]
```

**What:** TSB goes negative for 3 weeks, rebounds in recovery week, repeat.

**Result:** Progressive fitness building with adequate recovery.

**This is the ideal training pattern.**

---

### Pattern 2: The Downward Spiral (Danger)

```
TSB
  0 ────────────────────────
      ↘
-20       ↘
              ↘
-40               ↘
                      ↘
-60                       ●  Overtraining!
```

**What:** TSB becomes increasingly negative without recovery.

**Result:** Overtraining, illness, injury.

**Prevention:** Force [[Recovery Week]] every 3-4 weeks, even if you "feel fine."

---

### Pattern 3: The Flatline (Stagnation)

```
TSB
+10 ──────────────────────
  0 ──────────────────────
-10 ──────────────────────
     [Weeks of similar training]
```

**What:** TSB stays in narrow range, never going very negative.

**Result:** Maintenance, not building fitness.

**When this is OK:**
- Transition period
- Injury recovery
- Off-season maintenance

**When this is bad:**
- Build phase (need overload!)

---

### Pattern 4: The Launch Pad (Taper)

```
TSB
+40                      ●  RACE!
                     ↗
+20              ↗
             ↗
  0      ↗
     ↗
-20  ●
   [Start taper → Race]
```

**What:** TSB rises steeply from negative to positive.

**Result:** Shedding fatigue while maintaining fitness = peak performance.

**This is the taper pattern you want.**

---

## Using TSB Day-to-Day

### Morning Check

**Every morning, review:**
1. **Yesterday's TSS** (how much stress added)
2. **Today's TSB** (current form)
3. **Trend** (is TSB rising or falling)

**Decision making:**
- TSB very negative (< -30): Consider easier day
- TSB moderately negative (-10 to -30): Train as planned
- TSB positive: Good day for quality workout

### Workout Planning

**Hard workout (intervals, threshold):**
- Best when TSB > -20
- Deeper negative TSB = harder to hit targets
- If TSB < -30, consider moving hard workout or making it easier

**Long workout (volume):**
- Can do even with negative TSB
- Adds significant TSS, drives TSB more negative
- Schedule before recovery day/week

**Easy workout:**
- Fine at any TSB
- Helps recovery (raises TSB toward less negative)

---

## TSB in Different Sports

### Single Sport (Cycling)

**Straightforward:**
- One TSS source
- Direct CTL/ATL/TSB calculation
- Easy interpretation

### Triathlon (Multi-Sport)

**More complex:**
- TSS from three sports combined
- Different fatigue types not distinguished
- 100 run TSS ≠ 100 bike TSS in actual fatigue

**Practical approach:**
- Use total TSB for overall picture
- Pay special attention to run TSS (most fatiguing)
- Supplement with subjective feel

**Example:**
- Total TSB: -15 (seems fine)
- But if most TSS from running: might be more fatigued than TSB suggests

---

## Advanced: TSB Manipulation

### Planned Overreaching

**Strategy:** Deliberately drive TSB very negative (-40 to -60) for 1-2 weeks, then recover.

**Goal:** Supercompensation - body adapts to high stress, fitness jumps.

**Risks:**
- Injury
- Illness
- Overtraining
- Requires experience

**Only attempt if:**
- Experienced athlete
- Strong training history
- Carefully monitored
- Planned recovery immediately after

**Not recommended for most age-groupers.**

---

### Race Simulation

**4-6 weeks before A-race:**
- Do B-race or hard workout at target race intensity
- With moderate TSB (-5 to +10)
- Tests if current fitness is sufficient
- Practice race execution

**2-3 weeks before A-race:**
- Peak training load
- TSB deeply negative (-30 to -40)
- Final fitness stimulus

**1-2 weeks before A-race:**
- Taper begins
- TSB rises rapidly
- Shed fatigue

**Race day:**
- TSB +20 to +35
- Peak performance

---

## TSB and Illness

### When Getting Sick

**Warning signs:**
- TSB very negative (< -40)
- Plus: elevated resting HR, poor sleep, mood changes
- Immune system compromised

**If you get sick:**
- Stop training immediately
- TSB will rise rapidly (no training = ATL drops)
- Don't resume until healthy

### Returning From Illness

**After sickness:**
- CTL decayed
- ATL near zero
- TSB strongly positive (+30 to +60)

**TSB is misleading here:**
- High TSB suggests "ready to train hard"
- But actually detrained and weak

**Reality check needed:**
- Start easy despite positive TSB
- Rebuild gradually
- Let CTL rebuild before pushing ATL

---

## Psychological Aspects

### TSB and Motivation

**Negative TSB = low motivation (normal!):**
- Training feels hard
- Lack of "pop"
- Mentally harder to push

**Positive TSB = high motivation:**
- Workouts feel easier
- Mentally sharp
- Eager to train

**Important:** Don't let positive TSB seduce you into overtraining during taper!

### TSB and Confidence

**Race week, positive TSB:**
- Some athletes worry: "I feel too good, am I losing fitness?"
- This is the taper paranoia
- Trust the process

**Trust your TSB:**
- CTL shows fitness still high
- ATL shows fatigue low
- TSB positive = ready to race!

2. **Golden Cheetah** (free)
   - Excellent PMC implementation
   - Customizable

3. **Intervals.icu** (free)
   - Clean interface
   - Good PMC

4. **WKO5**

---

## The Complete Picture: CTL + ATL + TSB

**All three together tell the story:**

```
Metric | Value | Interpretation
-------|-------|---------------
CTL    |  95   | Good fitness
ATL    |  35   | Low fatigue
TSB    | +60   | Very fresh, ready to race!
```

**vs.**

```
Metric | Value | Interpretation
-------|-------|---------------
CTL    |  95   | Good fitness
ATL    | 110   | High fatigue
TSB    | -15   | Too tired to race well
```

**Same fitness, different race-day readiness!**

**The interplay:**
1. **Build CTL** through consistent training (takes weeks/months)
2. **Manage ATL** through smart programming (daily/weekly)
3. **Manipulate TSB** through taper (final 1-3 weeks before race)

**Result: High fitness (CTL), low fatigue (ATL), peak form (TSB).**

## Summary

**TSB (Training Stress Balance) is your form:**

**The formula:**
$$TSB = CTL - ATL$$

**Key concepts:**
1. **Simple subtraction:** Fitness minus fatigue
2. **Positive TSB** = fresh and ready to perform
3. **Negative TSB** = fatigued from training (normal during build)
4. **Target TSB for racing:** +15 to +35 (higher for longer races)
5. **Training TSB:** -20 to -35 (productive overload)
6. **Recovery week TSB:** Should rise significantly
7. **[[Taper Strategy|Taper]]** manipulates TSB from negative to positive
8. **Monitor daily** to guide training decisions

**The bottom line:** TSB predicts whether you're ready to perform (positive) or still accumulating training stress (negative). For racing, you want HIGH fitness (CTL), LOW fatigue (ATL), and therefore POSITIVE form (TSB).

**Race on positive TSB, train on negative TSB.**
