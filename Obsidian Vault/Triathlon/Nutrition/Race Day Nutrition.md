## Carbohydrate Intake During Racing

**General Guidelines:**
- **Sprint distance:** Usually no nutrition needed (< 1 hour)
- **Olympic distance:** 30-60g carbs/hour
- **Half Ironman:** 60-90g carbs/hour
- **Ironman:** 80-120g carbs/hour (train your gut!)

## Pre-Race Nutrition

**3-4 hours before start:**
- 2-3g carbs per kg bodyweight

- Example: white bread, banana, honey, jam

**30-60 min before start:**

## During Race

**Bike leg** (easiest to fuel):
- Start fueling early (20-30 min in)

**Electrolytes matter:**
- Sodium: 500-700mg per hour (hot conditions)
