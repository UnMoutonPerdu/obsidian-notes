## Macronutrient Priorities for Triathletes

### Carbohydrates (The Priority Fuel)

**Daily intake varies by training load:**
- **Easy training day:** 3-5g per kg bodyweight
- **Moderate training day:** 5-7g per kg bodyweight
- **Hard/Long training day:** 7-10g per kg bodyweight
- **Very hard day** (e.g., long bike + run): 10-12g per kg bodyweight

**Timing matters:**
- High carb before and after hard sessions
- Lower carb on easy days and [[Recovery Week]]

### Protein (Recovery & Adaptation)

**Target:** 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight daily

**Distribution:**
- Spread across 4-5 meals
- 20-40g per meal
- Post-workout: within 1-2 hours
- Before bed: casein protein for overnight recovery

### Fats (Hormones & Health)

**Target:** 0.8-1.5g per kg bodyweight
- Essential for hormone production
- Don't go too low (<20% of total calories)
- Focus on quality: omega-3, nuts, olive oil, avocado

## Nutrient Timing

### Around Hard Training

**Pre-workout (2-3h before):**
- Carb-rich, moderate protein
- Low fat, low fiber
- 1-2g carbs per kg bodyweight

**During workout** (>90 min):
- 30-60g carbs per hour
- Liquid/gel forms

**Post-workout (within 30-60 min):**
- 1-1.2g carbs per kg bodyweight
- 20-30g protein
- The "anabolic window" matters most after **hard** sessions

### Easy Training Days

- No special timing needed
- Focus on whole foods
- Normal meal schedule

## Hydration

**Daily baseline:**
- 30-40ml per kg bodyweight
- More in hot weather or high training load

**Check hydration status:**
- Urine color: pale yellow is optimal
- Morning weight: track trends
- Thirst: don't ignore it

## Practical Tips

1. **Eat enough:** Underfueling kills performance and recovery
2. **Carbs are not the enemy:** You need them for [[Training Stress Score|high TSS weeks]]
3. **Protein at every meal:** supports recovery
4. **Plan ahead:** meal prep on rest days
5. **Listen to hunger:** training increases appetite for a reason

## Recovery Week Nutrition

During [[Recovery Week]]:
- Reduce carb intake by ~20-30%
- Maintain protein intake
- Opportunity to focus on food quality
- Don't severely restrict: you're still training!
