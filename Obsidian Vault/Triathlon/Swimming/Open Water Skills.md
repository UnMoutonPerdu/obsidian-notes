# Open Water Swimming Skills

**Pool swimming ≠ Open Water swimming**

Open water introduces: waves, currents, other swimmers, no walls, no lane lines, murky water, and sighting requirements.

---

## Key Differences from Pool

**Pool:**
- Clear water, see bottom
- Black line to follow
- Walls for rest/push-off
- Controlled temperature
- Alone or few swimmers

**Open Water:**
- Limited visibility
- No reference line (must sight)
- No walls (must float/tread to rest)
- Variable temperature
- Mass starts with contact

**You must practice open water skills before race day!**

---

## Sighting (Most Critical Skill)

**Why it matters:**
Swimming straight = swimming shorter distance. Even 5° off course over 1500m = swimming 130m extra!

### Sighting Technique

**Crocodile eyes method:**
1. During normal stroke cycle, press down slightly with lead arm
2. Lift head just enough to get eyes above water (not chest!)
3. Look forward, spot target buoy
4. Drop head back to normal position
5. Continue swimming

**Common mistakes:**
- Lifting too high (sinks hips = slows down)
- Holding breath while sighting
- Disrupting entire stroke rhythm

### Sighting Frequency

**Calm conditions, straight course:**
- Every 6-10 strokes
- Less frequent = faster (but risk going off course)

**Choppy water, turns, congested:**
- Every 4-6 strokes
- Around turns: sight more frequently

**Practice drill:**
- In pool, swim length with eyes closed
- Sight every 6 strokes
- See how straight you can swim

---

## Bilateral Breathing for Open Water

**Why it matters in open water:**
- Sun may be on one side (blinding)
- Chop/waves on one side
- Need to see competitors on both sides
- Helps swim straight

**If you only breathe one side:** Start practicing bilateral NOW. Begin with every 3 strokes for short intervals.

---

## Drafting

**Drafting = free speed (save 20-30% energy)**

### Where to Draft

**Best position: Directly behind swimmer's feet**
- Most energy saved
- Some contact with feet (acceptable)
- Can see them easily

**Alternative: Beside and slightly behind hip**
- Less energy saved (~10-15%)
- Less risk of getting kicked
- Easier to see them and surroundings

**Don't draft beside shoulders:**
- No energy benefit
- In the stroke zone (will get hit)

### Drafting Etiquette

**DO:**
- Follow someone your speed or slightly faster
- Light contact with feet is normal
- Switch if they're slowing you down

**DON'T:**
- Grab feet or suit (will get kicked hard)
- Draft off someone much slower
- Fight to hold position if others are faster

### Finding Feet in a Race

**Start:** Find someone your pace in first 200-400m
**Mid-race:** If your group slows, move to faster group
**Buoy turns:** Groups often regroup, find new feet

---

## Mass Start Strategy

**Mass starts = chaos for first 100-200m**

### Positioning

**Front (only if you're FAST):**
- Most contact, most aggressive
- For competitive swimmers
- Gets you clear water quickest

**Middle (moderate speed):**
- Moderate contact expected
- Need to be comfortable with bumping
- Good compromise

**Back/Outside (less confident, afraid of contact):**
- Less contact but swim farther
- Slower swimmers will be here
- May need to navigate around people

**Outside edge, middle of pack:**
- Good compromise for most age groupers
- Some contact but manageable
- Not swimming much farther

### Surviving the Washing Machine

**First 200m:**
- Stay calm (everyone gets bumped)
- Maintain stroke rhythm despite contact
- Breathe regularly (don't panic-breathe)
- If grabbed/pulled: stop stroke briefly, let them pass
- Worst case: breaststroke for 10 strokes to settle

**Remember:** It settles down after a few minutes. Everyone goes through it.

---

## Buoy Turns

**Approaching turn:**
- Sight more frequently last 50m
- Position yourself on inside (shorter distance)
- Expect congestion

**At the turn:**
- Tight turn = advantage but more contact
- Wider turn = cleaner water but longer
- Breaststroke/water polo stroke acceptable for 2-3 strokes to navigate
- Find new feet after turn

---

## Dealing with Wetsuit

**Wetsuit benefits:**
- Buoyancy (faster for most people)
- Warmth
- Some protection from jellyfish/contact

**Wetsuit challenges:**
- Restrictive on shoulders if too tight
- Gets hot in warm water (>24°C)
- Removal in T1 takes time

### Wetsuit Tips

**Fitting:**
- Should be snug but not restrict breathing or shoulder rotation
- Proper size critical (too small = can't breathe)

**Putting on:**
- Baby powder or wetsuit spray inside
- Get it high on crotch (avoid restriction)
- Vaseline on neck/underarms to prevent chafing

**Removing in T1:**
- Unzip while running from water
- Pull arms out first
- Push down to waist
- Step on foot ends to pull off each leg

**Practice wetsuit removal several times before race!**

---

## Swimming in Currents

**Current = invisible force pushing sideways or forward/back**

### Spotting Current

- Look at buoys: are they drifting?
- Water flowing around stationary objects
- Ask locals/race briefing

### Swimming with Current

**Current behind you:**
- Free speed!
- Sight less frequently (being pushed forward)

**Current against you:**
- Sight more frequently
- Maintain effort (don't fight too hard)
- Tuck in behind someone (drafting more important)

**Side current (most common):**
- Aim upwind/upcurrent of target buoy
- Sight frequently to adjust
- Current will push you to buoy as you swim

---

## Choppy Water / Waves

**Waves disrupt rhythm and make sighting harder.**

### Techniques for Chop

**Breathing:**
- Breathe on calmer side if waves from one direction
- Time breath for valley between waves
- May need to skip a breath occasionally

**Stroke:**
- Maintain higher cadence (less glide)
- Punch through small waves
- Slightly higher elbow recovery (clear small waves)

**Sighting:**
- Sight from wave crest (better view)
- May need more frequent sighting

---

## Cold Water Acclimation

**Water <15°C: high risk without acclimation**
**Water 15-18°C: uncomfortable without practice**
**Water 18-22°C: cool but manageable**
**Water >22°C: comfortable**

### Dealing with Cold

**Acclimate before race:**
- Practice in similar temperature 2-3x minimum
- Build tolerance over weeks (don't shock system)

**Race day cold water:**
- Splash face with cold water before start (reduces gasp reflex)
- Slower warm-up (get body adjusted)
- Focus on breathing first 100m
- Neoprene cap helps (race allows usually)
- Wetsuit essential below 18°C

**Coldwater shock:**
- First 30-90s: rapid breathing, gasping (normal)
- Stay calm, focus on breathing rhythm
- Will pass if you control breathing

---

## Emergency Skills

**Treading water:**
- Practice in pool with no wall support
- Eggbeater kick most efficient
- Arms sculling gently

**Floating/resting:**
- Roll to back (backstroke position)
- Gentle kick, gentle scull
- Catch breath, calm down

**Removing cramp:**
- Stop swimming
- Float on back
- Stretch affected muscle
- Massage briefly
- Continue when ready

**Remember:** In wetsuit, you WILL float. You cannot sink.

## Open Water Training Protocol

**If you have access to open water:**

**Session 1-2: Basics**
- Get comfortable (no pressure)
- Practice sighting every 6 strokes
- Swim parallel to shore (safety)
- 10-20 min

**Session 3-5: Skills**
- Practice drafting with friend
- Practice sighting to buoys/landmarks
- Simulate race start (hard first 100m)
- 20-30 min

**Session 6+: Race simulation**
- Practice in race-day gear (wetsuit, goggles, cap)
- Simulate race distance
- Practice with small group if possible
- Navigate a triangular/rectangular course with turns

**Minimum: 3-4 open water sessions before race!**

---

## If You Can't Access Open Water

**Pool substitutes:**

1. **Sighting drill:** Every 6 strokes in pool
2. **Wetsuit swim:** Get approval to wear wetsuit in pool (feels different)
3. **No-wall drill:** Don't touch walls, flip turn or open turn immediately
4. **Mass start simulation:** Start with crowded lane
5. **Straight swimming drill:** Swim with eyes closed, see if you hit lane rope

**Not as good as real open water, but better than nothing!**

## Race Day Open Water Checklist

**30-45 min before start:**
- [ ] Goggles on, adjusted, tested (backup in bag)
- [ ] Wetsuit on (Vaseline applied)
- [ ] Swim cap on (race cap goes over your cap)
- [ ] Quick swim warm-up (5-10 min if allowed)
- [ ] Practice sighting to start/first buoy
- [ ] Splash cold water on face (acclimate)
- [ ] Know course (direction, number of buoys, turns)
- [ ] Bathroom one last time
- [ ] Deep breaths, stay calm

## Common Open Water Fears (And Rebuttals)

**"I'll panic with no walls"**
- Wetsuit = you float (can rest any time)
- Practice treading water in pool
- Breaststroke is always an option

**"I'll get kicked in the face"**
- Happens rarely, hurts briefly, keep swimming
- Seed yourself appropriately
- Goggles: bring backup pair to transition

**"I can't see in murky water"**
- You don't need to see (use sighting)
- Focus on feel and rhythm
- Everyone else in same situation

**"I'll swim off course"**
- Sight every 6-10 strokes
- Follow feet if possible
- Slight zig-zag is normal

**"What about sea creatures?"**
- Fish are more scared of you
- Jellyfish: possible but rare, wetsuit helps
- Sharks: statistically you're safer than driving to the race

## Bottom Line

**Open water skills can be learned and improved.**

**Priority order:**
1. **Sighting** (most important - swim straight = faster)
2. **Bilateral breathing** (versatility)
3. **Drafting** (free speed)
4. **Mass start comfort** (first 200m)

**Practice before race day. Period.**
