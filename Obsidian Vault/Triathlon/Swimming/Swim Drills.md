## Why Swim Drills?

Technique is **everything** in swimming. Unlike running and cycling where you can "power through" with poor form, swimming with bad technique means:
- More energy wasted
- Slower pace
- Fatigue accumulates faster
- Higher injury risk (shoulder especially)

**10% technique improvement = 10% speed improvement with same effort.**

## When to Do Drills

**Every swim session should include drills:**
- After warm-up
- 10-15 minutes minimum
- Focus on 2-3 drills per session
- Quality over quantity

**Drill work is NOT wasted time:**
- Builds better movement patterns
- Prevents injury
- Makes main sets more effective

## Core Freestyle Drills

### 1. Catch-Up Drill

**Purpose:** Improve stroke timing, balance, and extension

**How:**
- Start both arms extended in front (streamline)
- Pull with one arm through full stroke
- Wait for pulling hand to "catch up" to stationary hand before starting next stroke
- Forces rotation and patient stroke timing

**Focus:** Don't rush the stroke

---

### 2. Single Arm Drill (other arm extended)

**Purpose:** Isolate and improve single-arm mechanics

**How:**
- One arm extended in front in streamline
- Swim using only the other arm
- Breathe to swimming arm side
- Switch arms every 25m

**Focus:**
- High elbow catch
- Full extension and follow-through
- Body rotation initiating pull

---

### 3. Fist Drill (Swim with Closed Fists)

**Purpose:** Develop better "feel" for water and forearm catch

**How:**
- Swim freestyle with hands in fists
- Forces you to use forearm for catch
- Alternate 25m fist / 25m normal

**Focus:**
- Engage forearm in the pull
- When opening fists, feel increased propulsion

---

### 4. Fingertip Drag Drill

**Purpose:** High elbow recovery, body rotation

**How:**
- During recovery phase, drag fingertips along water surface
- Forces high elbow position
- Full rotation to get hand forward

**Focus:** Elbow leads the recovery, hand relaxed

---

### 5. 6-Kick Switch (Rotation Drill)

**Purpose:** Body rotation, balance, streamline

**How:**
- Push off in streamline, rotate to one side (one arm extended forward, one at side)
- Kick 6 times while on side
- One stroke to switch to other side
- Kick 6 times on new side
- Repeat

**Focus:**
- Head stable (look at bottom/side, not forward)
- Sharp rotation
- Streamlined position

---

### 6. Zipper Drill (High Elbow Recovery)

**Purpose:** Proper recovery mechanics

**How:**
- During recovery, thumb drags up side of body like pulling up a zipper
- From hip to armpit to ear
- Elbow stays high

**Focus:** Hand stays close to body, elbow high

---

### 7. Sculling Drill

**Purpose:** Develop feel for water, improve catch

**How:**
- Hands in front in streamline position
- Small side-to-side movements with hands
- Pitch hands to move forward using sculling only
- No kicking (pull buoy optional)

**Focus:**
- Feel pressure on palm and forearm
- Hands angled to push water back

---

## Kick Drills

### 1. Vertical Kicking

**Purpose:** Develop powerful kick

**How:**
- Tread water vertically in deep end
- Hands above water surface (or crossed on chest)
- Flutter kick to stay afloat
- 30s on, 30s rest, repeat 4-6x

**Focus:** Kick from hips, not knees

---

### 2. Side Kick Drill

**Purpose:** Rotation, streamline, kick mechanics

**How:**
- Kick on side, bottom arm extended, top arm at side
- Head rests on extended arm
- Breathe by rolling slightly to air
- 25m per side

**Focus:** Streamlined position, steady kick

---

## Breathing Drills

### 1. Bilateral Breathing (Every 3 Strokes)

**Purpose:** Balanced stroke, race versatility

**How:**
- Breathe every 3 strokes (alternating sides)
- If you always breathe one side: start now!

**Benefits:**
- Balanced stroke mechanics
- Sight both sides in open water
- Avoid sun/chop/other swimmers

---

### 2. Hypoxic Breathing (Use Sparingly)

**Purpose:** Breath control, efficiency

**How:**
- Breathe every 5, 7, or 9 strokes for short distances
- Not for entire session!

**Warning:**
- Limited benefit for triathletes
- Can sacrifice technique if overused
- Better to focus on streamlining than holding breath

---

## Drill Set Example (15 minutes)

**Warm-up:** 200m easy swim

**Drill block:**
- 4×50m as:
  - 25m drill / 25m swim (apply drill focus)
- Drill rotation:
  1. Catch-up drill
  2. Fist drill
  3. Fingertip drag
  4. Single arm (right)
  5. Single arm (left)
  6. Zipper drill

**Rest:** 15-20s between each 50m

**Total:** 200m warm-up + 300m drills = 500m (12-15 minutes)

---

## Drill Progression

**Beginner:**
- Master 2-3 basic drills (catch-up, single arm, fingertip drag)
- Drill every session

**Intermediate:**
- Rotate through 5-6 drills
- Start combining drills (e.g., fingertip drag + bilateral breathing)

**Advanced:**
- Use drills as warm-up
- Focus on subtle refinements
- Film yourself and compare to drills

---

## Common Drill Mistakes

1. **Rushing through drills:** Slow down, focus on form
2. **Only doing drills once per month:** Needs to be regular
3. **Not applying drill to normal swimming:** Transfer the feeling
4. **Kicking too hard during drills:** Save legs for bike/run
5. **Getting bored:** Vary drills, make it a game

---

## Video Analysis

**Film yourself every 4-6 weeks:**
- Underwater view is gold
- Compare to pro swimmers
- Identify your specific issues
- Target drills to fix weak points

---

## Bottom Line

**Drills are not "junk volume"** — they're technique investment that pays dividends across all swim training.

**If you only have 45 minutes to swim:**
- 10 min warm-up
- 15 min drills
- 15 min main set
- 5 min cool down

You'll improve faster than 45 minutes of mindless laps.
