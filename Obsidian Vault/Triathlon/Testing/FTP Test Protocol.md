## What is FTP?

**FTP** (Functional Threshold Power) is the maximum average power you can sustain for approximately one hour. It's the cornerstone metric for power-based cycling training.

**FTP determines your [[Intensity|training zones]]** and is used to calculate [[Normalized Power|NP]], [[Intensity Factor|IF]], and [[Training Stress Score|TSS]].

## When to Test FTP

- Every 8-12 weeks during training season
- After significant training block
- Start of new season
- When current zones feel too easy/hard

**Don't test during:**
- [[Recovery Week]]
- When fatigued from hard training
- When sick or injured
- Random "let's see where I'm at" days (unreliable)

## FTP Test Protocols

### Option 1: 20-Minute Test (Most Common)

**Most practical for most athletes.**

**Protocol:**
1. **Warm up:** 15-20 minutes progressive
   - Start easy
   - Include 2-3 efforts: 1 min @ Z3, 1 min @ Z4
   - Final 5 min easy spin

2. **Main set:** 20 minutes ALL-OUT
   - Max sustainable effort
   - Don't start too hard (even pacing is key)
   - Indoor trainer recommended (no coasting/traffic)
   - Use a flat route if outside

3. **Cool down:** 10-15 minutes easy

**Calculate FTP:**
$$FTP = Average\ Power_{20min} \times 0.95$$

The 0.95 factor accounts for the fact that 20-min power is slightly higher than true 60-min power.

### Option 2: Ramp Test (Shorter, More Painful)

**Quicker test, increasingly popular with indoor training.**

**Protocol:**
1. Warm up: 10-15 minutes easy
2. Start at very easy power (e.g., 100W)
3. Increase by 20W every minute until failure
4. Record final 1-minute average power before failure

**Calculate FTP:**
$$FTP = Max\ 1min\ Power \times 0.75$$

**Pros:** Quick (~20 min total), requires less pacing skill
**Cons:** Feels brutal, may slightly underestimate FTP for some

### Option 3: 2×8 Minute Test

**Alternative for those who struggle with pacing 20 minutes.**

**Protocol:**
1. Warm up: 15-20 minutes
2. 8 minutes ALL-OUT
3. 10 minutes easy recovery spin
4. 8 minutes ALL-OUT
5. Cool down: 10 minutes

**Calculate FTP:**
$$FTP = \frac{Avg\ Power_{8min\ \#1} + Avg\ Power_{8min\ \#2}}{2} \times 0.90$$

## Test Execution Tips

### Preparation (Day Before)

- Easy spin or rest day
- Well-fueled, well-hydrated
- Good sleep
- Mental preparation (it will hurt!)

### During Test

**Pacing strategy for 20-min test:**
- **Minutes 0-5:** Slightly under target, settle in
- **Minutes 5-15:** Lock into sustainable power
- **Minutes 15-18:** Hold on, resist fade
- **Minutes 18-20:** Empty the tank

**Mental tricks:**
- Break it into chunks (4×5 min)
- Focus on breathing and cadence
- Don't look at time remaining constantly
- Suffer now, benefit for months

### Environment

**Indoor (preferred):**
- No variables (traffic, wind, terrain)
- Controlled environment
- More accurate results
- Use a fan!

**Outdoor (acceptable):**
- Flat route, minimal stops
- Low traffic
- No aero position (steady effort harder in aero)
- Account for wind/conditions

## Post-Test

### Analyzing Results

**FTP increased?**
- Update training zones
- Adjust workout targets
- Celebrate progress!

**FTP stayed same?**
- Normal during maintenance
- May need training stimulus change

**FTP decreased?**
- Check for: illness, fatigue, life stress
- May need more recovery
- Consider if test was truly maximal

### Setting New Zones

Once you have FTP, recalculate [[Intensity|training zones]]:
- Z1: <55% FTP
- Z2: 60-70% FTP
- Sweet Spot: 84-90% FTP
- Threshold: 95-105% FTP
- VO₂max: 110-120% FTP

## Common Mistakes

1. **Testing too often:** More than once per month is overkill
2. **Not warming up properly:** Cold muscles = lower power
3. **Starting too hard:** Positive split = inaccurate result
4. **Testing when fatigued:** Will underestimate true FTP
5. **Inconsistent testing protocol:** Use same protocol each time
6. **Not updating zones:** Test is pointless if you don't use results

---

## Virtual FTP Estimation

**Some platforms (Zwift, TrainerRoad, Wahoo) estimate FTP:**
- Based on training data
- Can be reasonably accurate
- Still worth confirming with real test every few months

**Estimated FTP is a starting point, not gospel.**

---

## For Beginners

**Never tested before?**
1. Do a conservative first test
2. Better to slightly underestimate than overestimate
3. Retest in 4-6 weeks once you're training with zones
4. FTP will likely increase quickly in first year

---

## The Mental Game

**FTP tests hurt. A lot.**
- That's the point
- Embrace the suck
- The discomfort is temporary
- The training zones last 8-12 weeks

**"It never gets easier, you just go faster."** – Greg LeMond
