## Tri Bike vs Road Bike

**Road bike:**
- Versatile (group rides, sportives, racing)
- More comfortable for long distance
- Better handling
- Can add aero bars

**Tri bike:**
- More aerodynamic (faster at same power)
- Forward position = better for running off bike
- Harder to handle (especially in wind/corners)
- Not allowed in draft-legal racing
- $2000+ for decent entry-level

**Recommendation:**
- Start with road bike + aero bars
- Only get tri bike if:
  - Racing half/full distance regularly
  - Comfortable on road bike with aero bars
  - Budget allows ($2500+ for complete setup)

**Time saved with tri bike over road bike + aero bars: ~1-2 minutes on Olympic distance. Not worth it for beginners.**

### Shoes
**Running shoes:**

- Replace shoes when upper fails or sole cracks

### Wetsuits

## Bottom Line

**Start simple:**
- You don't need the latest gear
- Used equipment works great
- Fit and comfort > expensive and fancy
- Train more, shop less

**Upgrade priority:**
1. Fix anything causing discomfort/injury (bike fit, shoes)
2. Power meter (if serious about training)
3. Better wetsuit (if swimming often)
4. Indoor trainer (for consistency)
5. Everything else

**Most expensive ≠ fastest. Trained athlete on cheap bike > undertrained athlete on expensive bike.**
