I believe in the fact that muscles grow much more faster and stronger by doing the same strength sessions and exercises over and over, than by trying new exercises every week. 
In triathlon, muscles and especially tendons are constantly subjected to repetitive stress (biking/running/swimming = repetition of the same movement again and again)
