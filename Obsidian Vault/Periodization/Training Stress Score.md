**TSS** is a way to represent training work load from a training session. It is intended to represent the impact of a cycling session, but some variant allows computation for running and swimming sessions. 

**TSS** is the product of the duration by the intensity **squared**! That's why it is important to increase and practice volume first, and add intensity after. Adding optional intensities inside workouts increase a lot this **TSS**.
The formula is the following:
$$TSS = \frac{(duration \times NP \times IF)}{FTP \times 3600} \times 100$$
