*GPP = General Physical Preparedness*
I believe in the fact that muscles grow much more faster and stronger by doing the same strength sessions and exercises over and over, than by trying new exercises every week. 
In triathlon, muscles and especially tendons are constantly subjected to repetitive stress (biking/running/swimming = repetition of the same movement again and again). 

- Will start with 2 sessions a week ~40min (1 upper and 1 lower). The objective is not to make long and tiring sessions but to build mobility and tendon strength.
- After some weeks, probably go to 3 sessions a week with 2 lower and 1 upper. Still around ~45min. 

I think that having 3 sets of strength sessions and rotating them would be a good start. 
2 sets [[Set A]] and [[Set B]] for [[Loading Week]], 1 set [[Set C]] for [[Recovery Week]]
